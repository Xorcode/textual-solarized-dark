# Solarized Dark theme for Textual

After having searched through all the different themes available for Textual we could not find one that was compatible with the latest version of Textual, so we rolled our own based on Sapientia 1.3.

## Installation

    $ cd ~/Library/Containers/com.codeux.irc.textual/Data/Library/Application\ Support/Textual\ IRC/Styles/
    $ git clone https://github.com/Xorcode/textual-solarized-dark.git
